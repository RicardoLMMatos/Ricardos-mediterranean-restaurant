 ### The website is comprised of three pages(home page, gallery page and contact page), all accessible from the navigation menu.

 - #### All Pages on the website have:
    
 * Navigation bar consisting of the restaurant logo on the left side linked to the home page and a navigation menu on the right side with links to Home page, gallery page, menus (with a drop down menu that shows all the menus that open the desired menu with the    option to download it ) and a contact page.

# Design

#### Colour Scheme

For the colours I have used some market research to see what colours are trending and personal preference, I wanted to give the website a fine dininig yet warm and family friend place feeling.

#### Typography

I have have combined a classic type of font for the logo and Welcome message header to give the user a welcoming feeling and more modern fonts for the headers and body to be user frindly.
My preference for fallback font is serif.

All fonts used are from Google :

* [Great Vibes](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Great+Vibes?query=great+vibes) is used for the logo and Welcome message on the page.
* [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) is used for the most of the body text on the page.
* [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=playfair) is used for the headers text on the page.


#### Imagery 
I have used diferent sources for images and to create the logo.
 * To create the logo I have used Adobe express, free for personal use:

#### Wireframes

I have used Balsamic wireframe software to create my initial wireframes, for desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile.
The finished product came very close to the initial concept.
