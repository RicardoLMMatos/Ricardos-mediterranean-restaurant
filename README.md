## Structure ##

 ### The website is comprised of three pages(home page, gallery page and contact page), all accessible from the navigation menu.

 #### Common sections:
    
 * Navigation bar consisting of the restaurant logo on the left side linked to the home page and a navigation menu on the right side with links to Home page, book a table (linked to contact page for now), gallery page, menus (with a drop down menu that shows all the menus that open the desired menu with the  option to download it ) and a contact page.
 The navbar is fully responsive and changes to a burger menu on smaller screens still ofering the same links as the desktop.
 All the links change colour on hover for good user experince.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

For the colours I have used some market research to see what colours are trending and personal preference, I wanted to give the website a fine dininig yet warm and family friend place feeling.

### Typography

I have have combined a classic type of font for the logo and Welcome message header to give the user a welcoming feeling and more modern fonts for the headers and body to be user frindly.
My preference for fallback font is serif.

All fonts used are from Google :

* [Great Vibes](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Great+Vibes?query=great+vibes) is used for the logo and Welcome message on the page.
* [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) is used for the most of the body text on the page.
* [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=playfair) is used for the headers text on the page.


### Imagery 
I have used diferent sources for images and to create the logo and favicon, all free to use or with owners consent.
#### Logo 

When creating the logo I wantedto create a logo that would be easily associated with food but elegant and modern so I've used the "great Vibes" font for the Ricardo's word which is in my opinion easy to associate with food, specialy Italian food. For the rest of the logo I have used the "Montserrat" font which is  clean and modern.
